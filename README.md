Have you ever thought of integrating the two most amazing technologies out there ?

Well I have!!

Let us integrate Machine Learning with DevOps.

Our main objective would be to train our Machine Learning model and optimize it without the help of a human hand.

AIM: To train and tune our Machine Learning model automatically to achieve target accuracy. Also send an email to notify that the target accuracy is achieved.

NOTE: The accuracy.txt file shows 93 instead of 94 as jenkins job stopped adding layer and did not commit or push latest accuracy because of no change in local repo.
